# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create Splash component with basic structure



  - Create `src/components/Splash.tsx` with TypeScript interfaces
  - Implement basic component structure with logo, spinner, and progress bar
  - Add prop interface for onComplete callback
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement progress tracking and status messages



  - Add internal state management for progress percentage and status messages
  - Implement PROGRESS_STAGES mapping with Thai messages
  - Create progress simulation logic that updates through defined stages
  - Add useEffect hooks for progress timing and transitions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Add network status detection and offline badge



  - Implement navigator.onLine detection with event listeners
  - Create offline badge component that shows/hides based on network status
  - Add real-time network status updates without page reload
  - Handle edge cases for network detection API availability
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Implement accessibility and reduced motion support



  - Add prefers-reduced-motion media query detection
  - Implement conditional animation logic based on motion preferences
  - Add ARIA labels and screen reader support for progress updates
  - Ensure keyboard navigation and focus management
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Add splash-specific CSS styles to index.css



  - Create splash overlay styles with fixed positioning and z-index

  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Modify App.tsx to integrate boot stage



  - Extend AppState type to include 'boot' stage
  - Add splash component rendering when stage is 'boot'
  - Implement initialization sequence that progresses from 'boot' to 'start'

  - Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 7. Create comprehensive test suite



  - Write unit tests for Splash component covering all progress stages
  - Test network status detection and offline badge functionality
  - Test reduced motion preferences and accessibility features
  - Create integration tests for App.tsx boot sequence
  - Add visual regression tests for responsive layout
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through testing_

- [x] 8. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms



  - Implement timeout fallbacks for initialization stages
  - Add error boundary protection for splash component
  - Create graceful degradation for network detection failures
  - Add maximum initialization time limit with automatic progression
  - Implement logging for debugging initialization issues
  - _Requirements: 6.4, 6.5 (error handling aspects)_
